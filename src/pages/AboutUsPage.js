                Our Mission
              </h2>
              <p>
                "Note to Chef" makes adjusting for dietary accommodations simple
                by bringing common restrictions to the forefront of the recipe
                search experience. From the home page, select any number of
                overlapping dietary restrictions and a curated list of 10 top
                recipes will populate!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you find a recipe you enjoy, you can register for an account
                and save them to your profile for future use. You can also store
                recipes in a collection to make it easy to account for diverse
                dietary needs when planning for large gatherings. Additionally,
                a notes feature for saved recipes provides the ability to list
                adaptations to the recipe, and track details on each attempt.{" "}

              <p>
                "Note to Chef" makes it easy to take into consideration the

                About Us
              </h2>
              <p>
                Our team came together around a passion for nutrition and
                inclusion for diverse dietary needs during the GirlDevelopIt 2nd
                Annual Virtual Hackathon 2022.

              <p>
                {" "}
                Over the course of three days, we developed our application
                idea, coordinated teams for the frontend and backend, met in
                daily stand-ups, designed in Figma, worked asynchronously across
                timezones, thought through the user experience and built a
                close-knit community.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                All of us contributed to the success of this project, and we're
                pleased to present to you "Note to Chef"!
