# :taco: Mazanowski Recipe Book :sandwich: 

The Mazanowski Recipe Book website is based on the 1999 family recipe book compiled by Natalie Mazanowski.

Since the original copy was created, the family has grown and many family members have learned about their intolerance and allergies. My hope it that this application will help not only share these recipes to those without the physical copies, but to help those of us with dietary restrictions to enjoy the recipes.

This application is a one-dude[^1] undertaking and both the front-end and back-end has been implemented by yours truly. (So please be understanding if things are not perfect!)

## :croissant:  Coming Soon

### Database
After all base recipes have been entered, we will have a better idea of what we are working with. This will allow room for more features such as:
- Ingredient substitutions
- Create shopping list
- Measurement unit conversions
- Filtering
- Searching

### UI/UX Design
- Refresh and update styles
The front-end is far from finished, but does what it needs to do (allow for data entry, display the data, modify the data, and use authentication). Working without a wireframe, mockup, or any design reference has made it challenging to implement quick styles.
